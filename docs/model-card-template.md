# Model Card Template

> **Instructions**: This template provides a structured format for documenting your AI model when contributing to the BioImage Model Zoo. It integrates best practices from the [Hugging Face Model Card Template](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-card-annotated) while maintaining bioimage-specific requirements. Replace the placeholder text with information specific to your model. This documentation should be saved as `README.md` in your model folder and helps reviewers and users understand your model's purpose, performance, and appropriate usage.
